Project Overview

The ESP Sniffer can be configured to monitor Wi-Fi traffic in a controlled and authorized environment. By using a BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier) filter, the sniffer focuses on a single, specified access point rather than indiscriminately capturing all nearby traffic.

Advantages of BSSID Filtering

Focused Analysis
Filters out unrelated Wi-Fi noise and captures only traffic relevant to the specified router. This makes troubleshooting and monitoring more efficient in lab or authorized test setups.

Improved Privacy & Ethics
Unlike broad promiscuous sniffers, a BSSID-targeted approach avoids unnecessary collection of data from other nearby networks. This supports a more privacy-conscious and responsible methodology.

Resource Efficiency
By limiting the scope of captured packets, the ESP32’s constrained memory and CPU resources are used more effectively, ensuring greater stability during experiments.
